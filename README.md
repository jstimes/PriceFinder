# PriceFinder
An Android &amp; iOS app where users can search for and save products they are interested in, and be notified when an item has been found below their desired price.

Currently, the iOS app is almost complete, and the android app is mostly functionally complete, but has quite a bit of UI work needed still.

As I was wrapping up the iOS component, one of the last things I was doing was incorporating the Amazon API (one of the best online vendors and has support for retrieving recommended items). I discovered that their terms of service agreement does not allow any mobile app to display their Product Advertising content without written consent. Upon discovering that, I looked into the other API terms' of service I was using and they have some disappointing requirements as well. Until I find a workaround/get written consent from Amazon, this project is being put on hold.
